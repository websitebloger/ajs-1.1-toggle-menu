# ajs-1.1-toggle-menu
**Advanced JavaScript | Lecture 1 Task 1**

Our goal is to transform the attached menu into a collapsible/hidden menu.
- i.e. similar to the hamburger menus found on responsive websites We will do this without altering the HTML in any way.

The steps we need to take:
- Add a button to the HTML page
- Attach a "click" event handler to the button
- Hide the menu
- When the button is clicked:
    Show the menu if is hidden, hide it if it is not hidden
